My solution requires a basic calculator.

Looking for: 1,000,000th lexicographic permutation.
Since it is lexicographic, we can do the following.

Imagine if the first number is 0.
We have 0,xxx,xxx,xxx (where x is one of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

This leaves 9! possibilities. (362,880)

When all permutations of 0-9 are sorted, 0,xxx,xxx,xxx will occupy the first 362880 places in the list.
Likewise, 1,xxx,xxx,xxx will occupy the next 362880, and same with when 2 is the first number.

Therefore we know the first number of the solution is 2,xxx,xxx,xxx. So we treat the problem as though
we are looking for the (1,000,000 - 362880 - 362880 = 274240)'th lexicographical ordering of the list of
permutations of (0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).

Imagine if the second number is 0.
We have 2,0xx,xxx,xxx (where x is one of 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

This leaves 8! possibilities. (40,320)

We repeat the strategy from the beginning over and over, finding the next digit with each
iteration.

...

Eventually:

2,783,915,xxx (where x is one of 0,4,6)
This leaves 6 possibilities, and we are looking for the 4th.
The final answer is 2,783,915,460
